            <h6 class="disease_p">Dengue Virus (DENV)</h6>
            <p class="disease_p"><strong>Dengue</strong> is a mosquito-borne viral disease occurring in tropical and subtropical areas.
             <h6 class="disease_p"><strong>SYMPTOMS : </strong> include high fever, headache, rash and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases there is serious bleeding and shock, which can be life threatening. People may experience: Pain areas: in the abdomen, back, back of the eyes, bones, joints, or muscles; Whole body: chills, fatigue, fever, or loss of appetite; Gastrointestinal: nausea or vomiting; Skin: rashes or red spots; Also common: easy bruising or headache. Consult a doctor for medical advice.</h6>
             <h6 class="disease_p"><strong>TREATMENT : </strong> Treatment consists of pain medications and fluids   Treatment includes fluids and pain relievers. Severe cases require hospital care.   Supportive care:   Fluid replacement   Supplies or replenishes water and nutrients in the body.   Can be self-healing   Condition usually improves over time without treatment.   Oral hydration therapy   Giving fluid by mouth to treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea.   IV fluids   Delivering fluids, medication or blood directly into a vein.      Medications   Analgesic   Relieves pain.   Specialists   Infectious Disease Doctor   Treats infections, including those that are tropical in nature.   Primary Care Provider (PCP)  Prevents, diagnoses and treats diseases. Emergency Medical Doctor treats patients in the emergency department.</h6>
             <h6 class="disease_p disease_h"><strong>PRECAUTIONS : </strong> 
                 <h6 class="disease_p"> 1. Wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants. </h6>
                 <h6 class="disease_p"> 2.Treat clothes with repellents like permethrin. </h6>
                 <h6 class="disease_p"> 3.Use EPA-registered mosquito repellent like DEET. </h6>
                 <h6 class="disease_p"> 4.Consider using mosquito netting if you will be in an areas with many mosquitoes. </h6>
             <h6 class="disease_p disease_h"> <strong>IF YOU FEEL SICK and think you may have dengue: </strong> 
                 <h6 class="disease_p">1.Use acetaminophen. Do not take pain relievers that contain aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil), it may lead to a greater tendency to bleed. </h6>
                 <h6 class="disease_p">2.Get lots of rest, and drink plenty of liquids. </h6>
                 <h6 class="disease_p">3.Avoid spreading the disease by preventing more mosquito bites. </h6> 
             </h6>
            
             <h6 class="disease_p">Another very effective remedy is drinking papaya leaf juice. Papaya leaves are known to be the natural cure for dengue fever. The virus circulates in the blood of an infected person for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that the person develops a fever. Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection via Aedes mosquitoes after the first symptoms appear (during 4-5 days; maximum 12).It is possible to get dengue more than once. There are four different strains (serotypes) of the dengue virus. If a person has suffered from one virus, there can be a repeat occurrence if a different strain is subsequently involved. </h6> </h6>
             <h6 class="disease_p"><strong>ERADICATION AND PREVENTION :</strong> In the absence of an effective vaccine that protects humans from dengue, limiting contact between people and vectors is the most effective way to prevent dengue infections. Environmental management approaches involve eliminating the container habitats in which Aedes aegypti(Aedes Aegypti are a type of mosquito) lay their eggs. Here are other measures that you can adopt to prevent your home from infestation.   
                 <h6 class="disease_p">1.Get rid of stagnant water. </h6>  
                 <h6 class="disease_p">2.Cover your window and doors with net screens. </h6>  
                 <h6 class="disease_p">3.Using Mosquito repellent.   
                 <h6 class="disease_p">4.Spray pesticides in the corners. </h6>  
                 <h6 class="disease_p">5.Use camphor as a mosquito repellent. </h6>  
                 <h6 class="disease_p">6.Tulsi plant as a mosquito repellent. </h6>  
                 <h6 class="disease_p">7.Lavender oil. </h6>  
             <h6 class="disease_p">Avoid Dengue by Preventing Mosquito Bites. Use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and control mosquitoes inside and outside your home. Each year, an estimated 400 million people are infected with dengue.</h6> </h6>
